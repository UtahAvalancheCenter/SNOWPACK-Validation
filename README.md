# SNOWPACK-Validation
Repository for a golden dataset of CAAML V6.0 files, standards of practice, and use cases for *Validation and improvements to a numerical snow cover avalanche tool, SNOWPACK*. CAAML V6.0 files are manually submitted snow profiles taken at the Atwater Study Plot in Alta, UT. The study plot is located on flat terrain at an elevation of 8752 feet (Lat/Lon: 40.59148, -111.63778), and is maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The study plot measures snow water equivalent (SWE), precipitation accumulation, air temperature, snow depth, soil moisture percent, soil temperature, salinity, and real dielectric constant. Instruments used to measure these variables include:
- Pressure Transducer - 100" Druck
- Air Temp - Apogee St300
- Snow Depth - Campbell Snowvue
- Soil Moist/temp - Stevens Hydraprobe Analog
