# SNOWPACK-Validation
Repository for a golden dataset of CAAML V6.0 files, standards of practice, and use cases for *Validation and improvements to a numerical snow cover avalanche tool, SNOWPACK*. CAAML V6.0 files are manually submitted snow profiles taken at the Atwater Study Plot in Alta, UT. The study plot is located on flat terrain at an elevation of 8752 feet (Lat/Lon: 40.59148, -111.63778), and is maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The study plot measures snow water equivalent (SWE), precipitation accumulation, air temperature, snow depth, soil moisture percent, soil temperature, salinity, and real dielectric constant. Instruments used to measure these variables include:
- Pressure Transducer - 100" Druck
- Air Temp - Apogee St300
- Snow Depth - Campbell Snowvue
- Soil Moist/temp - Stevens Hydraprobe Analog

Variables included in a golden standard CAAML V6.0 manually submitted snow profile include:
- Latitude and longitude
- Elevation
- Aspect
- Date and time
- Slope angle
- Height of snow
- Temperature profile
- Full-depth layer identification complete with layer hardness, grain identification, and grain size. Each layer must only contain a single hardness classification.
